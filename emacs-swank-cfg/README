The SWANK server included in XARF's SBCL process by the script
XARF_HOME/bin/start-xarf requires the configuration defined in
~/.swank.lisp in order to save REPL-compiled fasls in the correct
location.

Likewise, the script XARF_HOME/bin/repl-xarf invokes emacs+SLIME,
which requires configuration in ~/.emacs.

Reference copies of these two files are kept in this directory
(XARF_HOME/emacs-swank-cfg/), named 'dot-swank.lisp' & 'dot-emacs'.
