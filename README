 Gather/process information from application hosts or databases
 and present the results in graphical or tabular form via a
 user-authenticated web interface with role based access control.

Configuration:

See xarf-env and src/*config.lisp.

To add, remove, or edit Quicktime/webTA instances, edit
$XARF_HOME/src/(qt|wt)-config.lisp, then restart XARF.


Process control:

  $XARF_HOME/bin/start-xarf
  $XARF_HOME/bin/stop-xarf


To connect to XARF's REPL:

  1. $XARF_HOME/bin/repl-xarf

     -OR-

     In emacs:
     Open a connection to sbcl's SWANK server on local port 4005:
     M-x slime-connect [RET]
     127.0.0.1 [RET]
     4005 [RET]


  2. To exit the REPL without killing XARF's sbcl process: 
     M-x slime-disconnect [RET]
     C-x C-c


  NOTES -- 

    Emacs keyboard command notation: 'M-x' means to hit the 'x' key while
    holding down 'Alt' (aka 'Meta'). Likewise, 'C-x' means to hit 'x' while
    holding down 'Ctrl'. [RET] means hit 'Enter'.

    Information regarding the configuration requirements for Emacs and
    SLIME/SWANK on the host that runs XARF can be found in
    $XARF_HOME/emacs-swank-cfg/.


To see if XARF is runnning: ps -ef |grep sbcl |grep -v grep

To see network ports on which it's listening: netstat -tulnp |grep sbcl


System requirements:

  Linux 2.6+ running on x86 or x86-64 architecture

  SBCL 1.x or newer with threading support

  Common Lisp libraries (deploy in XARF_HOME/extlib/):
  hunchentoot, cl-who, cl-ppcre, ironclad, adw-charting, cl-smtp, cl-pass
