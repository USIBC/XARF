One way to make a private key & self-signed SSL certificate:


openssl genrsa -out privatekey.pem 1024

openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key privatekey.pem > cert.pem

Use the DNS portion of XARF's URL as the Common Name.

chmod 600 *pem


$XARF_HOME/ssl/ sould contain the following files, each with 600 permissions:

  privatekey.pem
  cert.pem
