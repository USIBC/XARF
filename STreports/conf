### Configuration file for XARF backend '$XARF_HOME/STreports/run'
### D. Racine 20160128


# MAP is a multi-line string that relates four pieces of information
# required for each report:
#
#  * A rungroup identifier that causes this report to be generated when
#    'STreports/run' is invoked with this rungroup as one of its parameters.
#
#  * The report's title
#
#  * The name of the jar file that produces the report
#
#  * A string-constant parameter that the java program (sometimes) requires
#
# Format as follows, one report per line --
#
#   rungroup:Title:jarfile:javaParameter
#
# Titles are as specified by the PMO and are included in the report file names.
#
# The jarfile field must match the name of a jar in $XARF_HOME/STreports/jars/.
#
# Scheduling: There should be 1 cron job scheduled for each unique rungroup
# specified in the first column of MAP. For example, if { 7 8 } is the set
# of unique rungroup field values among all MAP rows, then the following two
# cron jobs will produce all rungroup '7' reports at 7am and all rungroup '8'
# reports at 8am, respectively:
#
# 00 07 * * 1-5 /XARF_HOME/STreports/run 7 >/XARF_HOME/STreports/runlog7 2>&1
# 00 08 * * 1-5 /XARF_HOME/STreports/run 8 >/XARF_HOME/STreports/runlog8 2>&1
